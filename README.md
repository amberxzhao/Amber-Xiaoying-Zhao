# Data Science Project Portfolio

## [Project 1: Time Series Forecast](https://github.com/amberxzhao/Time-Series-Forecast-Maximum-Weed-Speed)
### Maximum Wind Speed in Central New York:<br />	Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) Modeling <br />	
•	Identified the research interests and analysis objective, and collected raw data from online open data source <br />
•	Conducted data preparation for further analysis, including data cleaning and data property exploration (character, stationarity, decomposition) <br />
•	Applied the concepts and techniques of data mining on large data sets of an original topic <br />
•	Built seasonal auto regressive integrated moving average model via R <br />
•	Generated modeling analysis and prediction results into a comprehensive research report <br />

## [Project 2: Multiple Linear Regression Analysis](https://github.com/amberxzhao/HaborWaterQuality)
### Habor Water Quality
•	Understood the analysis objective and identified the critical problem <br /> 
•	Collected initial data from creditable data source and explored data properties <br /> 
•	Selected, cleaned, constructed, and formatted data into desired form <br /> 
•	Applied the concepts and techniques of data mining on large data sets of an original topic <br /> 
•	Modeled data in running regression-based and classification-based data mining methods in R and SAS <br /> 
•	Mastered the graphical tool and principles of exploratory data analysis to evaluate data <br /> 
•	Developed skills in interpreting and explaining the results of data mining experiments in complete report <br /> 

## [Project 3: Classification Tree](https://github.com/amberxzhao/Classification_Tree)
### Stock Data & Water Assessment Data
This project explored the basic concept of classification and regression tree (CART), then it presented the application of R package tree and applied CART to two different datasets: stock prices and water assessment.

## [Project 4: Logistic Regression](https://github.com/amberxzhao/LogisticRegression_GreenTaxi)
### Green Taxi Data
•	Identified the critical problem and established the analysis objective   <br />
•	Collected creditable raw data from NYC Open Data  <br />
•	Explored data properties, then cleaned and formatted data into desired form  <br />
•	Applied the concepts and techniques of data mining on large data sets of an original topic <br />
•	Modeled data in logistic regression method in R  <br />
•	Conducted data visualization of exploratory data analysis to present an accessible way to see and understand data insight  <br />
•	Summarized data analysis results into comprehensive research report  <br />

## [Project 5: Time Series Study: Stock Volatility](https://github.com/amberxzhao/TimeSeries_StockVolitality)
### Volatility Estimation of Facebook Stock using Garch Modeling
This project explored the stock market volatility using garch model. It was common sense that news, either good or bad, had huge impacts on the stock market. To find a company with substantial changes in its stock, this project emphasized on the companies with big scandals then finally decided to study volatility by using Facebook stock price data.<br />


## [Project 6: Hypothesis Test](https://github.com/amberxzhao/HypothesisTest_PregnancyStatusAndBabyWeight)
### Impact of Education Level and Smoking Status of Pregnancy Women: Baby Weight Dataset Exploration
This project established three research questions based on the 1997 birth weight data
from National Center for Health Statistics to study the mother’s effects on baby weight. The
project focused on exploring the impacts of education level and smoking status of expectant
mother on infant’s weight and mother’s weight gain. <br />

1. Explored ossible factors to classify whether mother was a smoker (logistic regression) <br />
2. Studied the effect of mother’s education level on mother’s weight gain via by  (permutation test: Wilcoxon Rank Sum test)<br />
3. Analyzed the effect of mother’s education level and smoking status on infant weight (ANOVA & cross-validation analysis)<br />

Each question was discussed by its rationale, statistical model, SAS output, and conclusion. <br />
