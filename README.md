Maximum Wind Speed in Central New York: Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) Modeling <br />	
•	Identified the research interests and analysis objective, and collected raw data from online open data source <br />
•	Conducted data preparation for further analysis, including data cleaning and data property exploration (character, stationarity, decomposition) <br />
•	Applied the concepts and techniques of data mining on large data sets of an original topic <br />
•	Built seasonal auto regressive integrated moving average model via R <br />
•	Generated modeling analysis and prediction results into a comprehensive research report <br />
